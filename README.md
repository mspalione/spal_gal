SpalGal is a personal public speaking website I created to primarily practice JavaScript. 
The six boxes at the bottom of the page will eventually contain click-through links and function as a menu.

The project took a standstill once I started classes back up. 

The JS works well for what is displayed, but words will drop down in each section after clicking on it. 
I experienced difficulty making this work for mediaqueries as the sections moved from vertical to horizontal. 

To view this, clone and open in Visual Studio Code and run HTML locally.
